# Toggable Badge After Spawn
Keeping in mind that FBIs can't use this mod without using the toggle, as it exposes UCs; bringing you the togglable version of badge_after_spawn.lua that serves its purpose well.

Config file version currently in development; toggle for now is false as the game starts.
